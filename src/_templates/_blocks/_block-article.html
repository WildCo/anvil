            Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? What's the meaning of this. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nuttcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

            Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.
