## What is Anvil?
Anvil is a tool for styleguide driven front end development. This tool leverages Gulp.js, SCSS, Nunjucks templating, and Node.js.

### Primary dependancies
- [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org) - A JavaScript runtime and node node package manager
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Automate and enhance your workflow

### Secondary dependancies
- [SCSS(SASS)](http://sass-lang.com) - CSS with superpowers
- [Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - The most advanced responsive
front-end framework in the world

## Todo
Todos and issues are being tracked in [Github Issues] (https://github.com/SpryDigital/nimble_builder/issues)

## Thoughts
- Possibly turn this into a Slush Generator (kind of like Yeoman but for Gulp specificaly)
